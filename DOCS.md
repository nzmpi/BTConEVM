# Documentation

There are 2 main contracts: `Wallet` to sign and send transactions, and `Node` to verify and mine blocks.

## [Wallet](https://github.com/nzmpi/BTConEVM/blob/master/src/Wallet.sol)

The `Wallet` contract is a "wallet" for signing and sending transactions. It supports P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH and P2WSH scripts.
It can also be used as a multisig wallet. 

To send a transaction, you need to provide `InputArgs` and `OutputArgs`. `InputArgs` contains input types, indeces of the signing private keys, `txId`s and `vout`s for UTXOs to spend. `OutputArgs` contains output types, amounts, addresses and redeem/witness scripts.

For all transactions the wallet uses `version = 1`, `sequence = 0xffffffff`, `locktime = 0` and signs with `SIGHASH_ALL`. 

Also provides an address based on the script type, index or amount, and Mainnet or Testnet parameters. 

BEWARE: The `Wallet` contract is not a secure wallet. It is not recommended to use it for anything other than testing, because it keeps all the private keys in storage.

## [Node](https://github.com/nzmpi/BTConEVM/blob/master/src/Node.sol)

The `Node` contract is a node that verifies transactions and mines blocks. It supports P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH and P2WSH scripts. When deployed, it creates the same genesis block that Bitcoin has.

To create a block it needs an array of transactions and an array of additional data, e.g. `redeemScript`. First it creates a coinbase transaction, then it validates the transactions and creates a block. 
Creating a block includes finding correct bits, which determines the target and difficulty, and if it needs an adjustment. Then calculates the merkle root of all transactions. And finally tries to find a nonce.

Validating a transaction includes checking if UTXOs exist, checking the signature by validating the script and collecting fees. All transactions must be created with `SIGHASH_ALL`.

Finding a nonce may fail (if `uint32` is not enough) or just run out of gas. This a downside of Solidity. But technically it's the same as in Bitcoin.

## Other Contracts

### [Script](https://github.com/nzmpi/BTConEVM/blob/master/src/Script.sol)

This contract emulates the Script language. It is called by the `Node` contract and expects `script`, which is `ScriptSig + ScriptPubKey`, `signatureHash` and `witness` for P2WPKH and P2WSH. If `script` fails, it reverts, otherwise nothing happens.

All supported opcodes can be found in the constructor.

## Libraries

### [Address](https://github.com/nzmpi/BTConEVM/blob/master/src/lib/Address.sol)
